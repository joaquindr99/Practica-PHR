TIMING-50#1 Warning
Unrealistic path requirement between same-level latches  
There is a timing paths between the source pin CIRCUITO/REGout0/auxclk_reg/G and the destination pin CIRCUITO/REGout0/auxclk_reg/D. The two latches are positive level-sensitive with a 0ns path requirement. The 0ns path requirement is coming from the conservative latch analysis and could severely impact the runtime due to time borrowing calculation. It is not recommended to have such topology unless there is a multicycle path constraint to adjust the path requirement to a realistic value (at least half clock period).
